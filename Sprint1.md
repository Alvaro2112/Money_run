I implemented the main menu interface where the user will be be able to start a game and see different things, such as his stats or his profile. I struggled a bit 
implementing the sliding menu for this interface and I found it especially complicated to test the activities. Finally, I was not able to link this interface with the
login interface as the login interface has not been merged yet with the master branch. I think for next time we should try to coordinate better to avoid these kinds of bottlenecks.
